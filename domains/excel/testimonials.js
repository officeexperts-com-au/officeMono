Primarily the software was designed to enable our property inspectors to collect onsite data and upload to a back-end database from the field, therefore removing the need to go back to the office to manually upload the data. The secondary phase of our IT development was to create a program that could analyse and process the uploaded data with minimal input, a feat successfully achieved by Office Experts. From our experience the staff at Office Experts have often gone beyond expectations. Their commitment to the project and their drive to deliver the end product is achieved through professionalism, experience and a solid work ethic.",

As a professional, she was able not only to understand very quickly our needs but also flexible and dynamic enough to implement and complete all the necessary tasks to efficiently deliver the required results. Linda has a wide understanding of the B2B operational key areas and thanks to her outstanding communication skills she has provided an extremely valuable feedback to produce a system that will serve our purposes in the years to come. We are looking forward to working with Office Experts and Linda in future projects.

Right from the 'get go' Jason was not only communicable but made time to understand my deliverables and took ownership of the task. As well as electronic correspondence Jason opened a verbal dialogue which was very important to me as we were able to fully understand the 'build' and 'pathway' to improvements he introduced into the project. Jason listened and went 'above & beyond' by introducing 'smarts' into the project that I didn't think of from the outset. At the end I got more than expected in a timely manner and an effective program; and all within our budget.
