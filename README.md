# Experts mono repo

Nested are the 5 domains used throughout the experts group, the decision has been made to have a mono repo for the experts group.

- due to the fact there will be so many shared components and styles.
- Packages and config files will all live under one roof, making future updates easier.
- Navigating between multiple repos will be a pain.

## Installations

So far we have installed the following:

- Next, React & React Dom (required)
- Babel and Eslint (help with type safety & catch errors)
- Turbo (this package will help us with building and deploying to multiple domains from a monorepo)
- Next-sitemap (automatically generate a sitemap.xml file & robots.txt on build)
- axios, cheerio (these are node js packages for making http requests and parsing data to our repo, currently just being used as webscrapers (can delete in final production))

## Sitemap creation

Is a little strange given all the domains, so a config file is added in each domains root path, the package.json has been configured to run a node script /generate-sitemap.js, this will generate a sitemap.xml file in the root of the domain.
\*\* This is untested waters for Dan, but the logic seems sound!

# Dev notes TODO

- change image paths in metadata and schemas, use full paths.
- create icons: {
  icon: "/favicon.ico",
  shortcut: "/favicon-32x32.png",
  apple: "/apple-touch-icon.png",
  },
  // resize existing logos
- decide on nesting public folders for different logos
- create canonical duplicate tags for quote, contact us, meet the teams and any others we find along the way
- Get Sendgrid key (share a .env.local file via email)
- redirects for the blog page's, rather than the current redirect to home, redirect to officeexperts.com.au/blog
